Why jQuery makes front-end programming so easy (donâ€™t forget to tweet today, with the hashtag #ilovejquery :))
jQuery gained popularity for its ability to simplify common tasks in JavaScript, such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and AJAX requests. It provided a concise and consistent API that abstracted away many browser compatibility issues. However, as modern JavaScript and browser APIs have improved, jQuery's necessity has decreased.

How to select HTML elements in JavaScript
In JavaScript, you can select HTML elements using various methods, such as document.getElementById(), document.getElementsByClassName(), document.getElementsByTagName(), and document.querySelector(). These methods allow you to select elements based on their ID, class, tag name, or CSS selector.

What are differences between ID, class, and tag name selectors
ID selector (#id): Selects a single element with the specified ID attribute, which should be unique within the document.
Class selector (.class): Selects all elements with the specified class attribute.
Tag name selector (tagname): Selects all elements with the specified tag name.
